## 🏮 Introduction

Pok-assembly is a modern remake of the classic combats in Pokemon games, rebuilt from the ground up in advanced x86 16-bit Assembly using NASM and executed through DOSBox. The game takes into account type advantages, moves, stats, and status effects.

## 🎛️ Prerequisites

To play the game, you'll need:

- NASM (Netwide Assembler): A popular assembler for x86 architecture.
- DOSBox: An x86 emulator with DOS for running 16-bit applications.

To create or edit games, you'll need the prerequisites above and:

- A code editor or IDE for Assembly programming (e.g., VSCode with Assembly extensions).

## Gameplay

### Attacks

Each Pokemon has **4 attacks assigned** to it. Each of them has a dedicated type, damage and so on.<br>
The more you use an attack, the more its _PPs_ are going to decrease.

### Team

In combat, you can see your **Pokemon team**, **switch Pokemon** and see which ones already fainted.
